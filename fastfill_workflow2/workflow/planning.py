"""One semantic planning pass; all hard constraints remain owned by the input.

The plan holds the support graph (``parents``), soft relation preferences, functional groups (an anchor and its
members), a placement priority, size hints and pose drafts. By default one LLM call proposes all of them
(``make_plan(..., llm=True)``); the input's support_parent values and hard ``on`` constraints stay locked, every LLM
field is checked, and any LLM failure falls back to the rule plan with the reason recorded in ``Plan.llm``.
``llm=False`` gives the rule plan alone (an ablation, and the offline tests).

Groups act through the solver's soft relations: a member gets a soft ``near`` to its anchor unless a relation
between the two already exists. Priority orders placement among objects whose supports are placed (1 = first).
